      <h2 class="h3 color-darkblue">How does Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record portal work?</h2>

      <p>The Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record portal draws COVID-19 records from California’s immunization systems. Enter your name, date of birth, and an email or mobile phone number associated with your vaccination record, then create a four-digit PIN. If the information you submitted matches the official record, you will receive a text or email with a link to your digital COVID-19 vaccine record. Enter the PIN you created to view the record.

        </p>


        <h2 class="h3 color-darkblue  mt-sm">How will my vaccine record be delivered?</h2>

        <p>When your vaccination record is found, you will receive a link delivered to the email or mobile phone number associated with the vaccination record. After entering your four-digit PIN, you will see your COVID-19 vaccination information including your name, date of birth, vaccination date(s), and vaccine manufacturer. You will also receive a scannable QR code confirming your vaccine record is authentic. See “Will my scanned information be saved?” below for more about the QR code.
          </p>


          <h2 class="h3 color-darkblue  mt-sm">What if my record is not found? </h2>
          <p>If the information you submitted does not return a link, you can re-enter your information making sure to use an email or phone associated with your vaccine record, and double check that your name and birthdate are correct. If your record still isn’t found, you may contact the COVID-19 Hot Line at 833-422-4255.</p>

          <h2 class="h3 color-darkblue  mt-sm">What if my digital vaccine record is incorrect?</h2>
          <p>If the information on your digital vaccine record is not correct, for instance missing a dose or the wrong dates or brand, you may call the COVID-19 Hot Line at 833-422-4255.</p>

          <h2 class="h3 color-darkblue  mt-sm">What if I made multiple vaccination appointments for multiple people with a single phone number? </h2>
          <p>If you are a parent or guardian and have created multiple appointments with a single phone number or email, enter the requests one at a time to receive separate links for each vaccine record.</p>

          <h2 class="h3 color-darkblue  mt-sm">Will my information remain private? </h2>
          <p>Yes. Filling out the form on the portal does not provide instant access to your vaccine record. The link to the vaccine record requires a PIN that you create and is sent only to the mobile phone or email that is associated with your immunization record. Only you can decide how and if you want to share your record with others.</p>

          <h2 class="h3 color-darkblue  mt-sm">Will my scanned information be saved?</h2>
          <p>No. The QR readers should comply with the <a href="https://vci.org/about#smart-health">SMART Health Card Framework</a>. The guidelines and code of conduct only allow reading of the QR code and prevent storing of the data in the QR code. Only you can decide when to share your vaccine record or QR code.</p>

          <h2 class="h3 color-darkblue  mt-sm">What should I do with my digital vaccine record?</h2>
          <p>You can take a screenshot of your vaccine record to store on your mobile device, save the QR code to your device’s camera roll, or print a copy of the record and store in a safe place. If you are at a venue that can read SMART Health Cards, present your copy of your digital vaccine record for scanning. If you lose your digital COVID-19 vaccine record, you can start the process over at the <a href="https://vaxrecord.cdt.ca.gov">Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record</a> portal. </p>

          <h2 class="h3 color-darkblue  mt-sm">What if I need to replace my vaccination card?</h2>
          <p>The portal provides a digital copy of your vaccine record. If you’ve lost your paper vaccine card, you may print out your digital record and use it at any place you may have presented your paper vaccination card.</p>


          <h2 class="h3 color-darkblue  mt-sm">Is this a vaccine passport? </h2>
          <p>No. You are not required to obtain a digital COVID-19 vaccine record. It is an optional means to obtain your COVID-19 vaccine information, and  is the digital version of your paper vaccine card. It is one of the options to show proof of vaccination. Governor Gavin Newsom has indicated that the State will not be implementing a mandatory passport system in California.</p>
