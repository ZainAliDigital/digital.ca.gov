<p>California’s new cannabis website, Cannabis.ca.gov, is live! We’re proud to have led the months-long collaboration with the Department of Technology and in partnership with the Department of Public Health, the Department of Food and Agriculture, the Bureau of Cannabis Control, and the brand new Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) to build the site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Site planning was just getting underway when COVID hit and was delayed for a year, but we got back to work this past February. And from the start, this project was one of collaboration, stakeholder engagement, and discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This website showcases many approaches that ODI is bringing to CA state website design and build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re elevating collaboration and openness. We’re pushing for greater simplicity in design and content. We’re using research and data to bring the user into every facet of the site. We continue to expand the practice of accessibility by prioritizing performance. And right now, we’re applying the lessons learned and improvements we’re pioneering to develop a broader design system that will ultimately change the way we design, build, and iterate government services online.</p>

<p>We made some really exciting progress on accessibility by exploring and developing a critical publishing innovation. Working in partnership with CDT, we collaborated with our department partners to conduct user research and develop effective, new content management practices. We demonstrated the value of a cross-functional team that brings together product management, user research, content strategy, analytics, design, and engineering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We continue to push the boundaries of traditional state website builds to put into practice the covid19.ca.gov and <a href="https://news.alpha.ca.gov/alpha-ca-gov-design-principles/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.alpha.ca.gov/alpha-ca-gov-design-principles/">alpha principles</a>, standards, and assets. <strong>But we’re not just building websites. We’re building on the lessons learned from our work on alpha.ca.gov and covid19.ca.gov, and pioneering new ways to share information and build services. </strong>The next step in this work is a comprehensive, end-to-end design system that makes it possible for any department to put these principles and lessons learned into practices.</p>

<h3><strong>Rethinking publishing to create a beautiful </strong><strong><em>and</em></strong><strong> fully accessible user experience</strong></h3>

<p>The way people experience websites starts in the publishing process. What you use or don’t use in publishing can significantly impact the way you deliver information or a service. Typically, when authoring content, state websites use third party tools like WordPress plugins. This approach is effective in facilitating website design and dev without writing code, but often leads to a bulky user experience with limited accessibility. These third party tools can also allow for <em>too </em>much design freedom, which can further diminish accessibility for the end user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following our north star of “Always Accessible,” we decided to experiment: We built our own WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) design tools on top of WordPress. This can look a lot of different ways, but in this case, we used WordPress to create our own custom Gutenberg blocks, creating an editing software that looks like the actual final output, while still being fully accessible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These magic (ok, if not magic then at least very cool) blocks also allow you to build content designs without any code know-how, and they have some key advantages over WordPress plugins. They’re fully accessible, they output leaner markup by tightly controlling the HTML delivered to the user so they only get the tags required by our design system, and they keep us within the design guardrails of our growing design system. Basically, we built features on top of WordPress to create fancy layouts while preserving accessibility. This is uncommon in the state’s publishing instances.</p>

<p>We tested this approach with the end user, in this case the content owner, because we were worried the design constraints might be difficult for the folks within the department responsible for adding content. We asked them: “If this editing interface uses custom blocks which intentionally limit your design choices, do you think that might be problematic?”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our main stakeholder in this process offered a very thoughtful and gratifying response: “I personally value consistency in all organization&#8217;s materials. It drives me bonkers when people spend time redesigning everything, the goal is to have a template. This helps people seeking information because they don&#8217;t have to reorient themselves. In managing a comms team I generally hammer in the focus should be on the content, design should be consistent. I like the constraints because it helps maintain that consistency.”</p>

<p>Our work here has enabled us and our partners to think of better ways to approach publishing content that is accessible from day one, and we look forward to exploring this further.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Data analytics and research informed the end product</strong></h3>

<p>Building a website nowadays is not difficult. But building and iterating on a website that is accessible, that understands its user, keeps its user engaged throughout their journey, and incorporates user feedback is not yet standard practice in government.</p>

<p>But that’s exactly what we did.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We used data from Google Analytics and user research to inform content and UX design, engineering, and executive decision making. We got great feedback from cannabis stakeholders. And we’re developing training right now to enable our partners in this practice of data-informed website design, development, and iteration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also developed a new analytics template for cannabis.ca.gov that we hope to scale across other ca.gov sites. This template will become a necessary tool for the DCC team to manage and prioritize content changes for their new site going forward as well as access new data that can inform strategy beyond content design.</p>

<p>We also developed and led a user research program in collaboration with CDT, building on the work done previously by California Health and Human Services Agency. Our team and CDT added an intercept to the cannabis website to better understand visitors’ needs. We tested the proposed architecture using card sorting to surface participants’ expectations and understanding of the topics. We also performed unmoderated and moderated user testing sessions of the website prototype with people who own and/ or operate a commercial cannabis business, are currently exploring opening a licensed cannabis business, or consult for the cannabis industry to validate the learnings gained with previous research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also applied the automated suite of accessibility tools and standards that we’ve spent the last year developing. We benchmarked performance and accessibility with Lighthouse, analyzed the readability of our copy with the Hemingway app, and tested with screen readers across multiple devices.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Stakeholder collaboration, training and enablement</strong></h3>

<p>This project took an interdisciplinary approach, bringing together several departments’ unique expertise and needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We convened multiple planning sessions to tap into their expertise and understand their policy goals so that we could as a team apply these essential components to UX, content design, research design, and development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We worked closely with the new department stakeholders to think through scope and development, and test content, design and engineering. We will continue to engage them as we dive deeper in showing them how to apply our approach on content design principles, analytics, and user research.</p>

<p>This close collaboration can be seen in the processes and assets our content design team created for long-term management of the site content. Our team led several content workshops focused on the art of writing in plain language. We started these by asking, “What does someone need to do on this page? What do they need to understand on this page?” The content directly reflects these basic but essential questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, we gave the DCC actionable strategies and performance tools to develop and maintain their own content with these critical questions in mind. They’re already adopting and practicing them—their first drafts came in with an average reading level of 7.5, according to Hemingway, which is a significant accomplishment for a government website. Most websites within the ca.gov domain average a grade 13.73 reading level (well above the Grade 5 level that is best practice).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Moving out of the crisis mindset&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>This new cannabis site also marks an important shift for our team, one that we’re really pleased about: a shift from COVID crisis response to a more measured, “build for the long term” mindset.</p>

<p>What’s cool about this transition is that we have so many lessons learned from the work we did on covid19.ca.gov that apply directly to this and other website builds. And now we have more time to experiment, test and iterate on those lessons learned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lessons like:</p>

<ul><li>The importance of creating structured agile processes, product roadmaps and release plans and strong UX research and design validation processes (which gives the team a sense of progress and what’s next).</li><li>The importance of creating consistent processes around stakeholder relationships (which helps set clear expectations and clear ownership).</li><li>The importance of multi stakeholder buy-in for new, innovative processes like using WordPress headlessly which allows us the flexibility to choose cheaper, more secure hosting options. This lets us build a slimmer, faster frontend. We could even smoothly switch CMS tools.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>Our work on Cannabis.ca.gov helped advance our design and development principles significantly. It gave us the opportunity to experiment, test and further iterate a lot of the innovations we introduced in alpha.ca.gov and covid19.ca.gov. And it put us in the perfect position to design and launch drought.ca.gov in just seven days. More on that come soon!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
